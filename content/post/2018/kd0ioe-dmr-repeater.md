There is now another digital option available in the Fargo-Moorhead metro area. I have put my DMR repeater online at my home QTH in West Fargo, on 444.625+ MHz. It is linked to the Internet and available for public use.

More information is available [at my website](https://kd0ioe.com/repeater/). You can also visit these websites for more general Brandmeister and DMR.
